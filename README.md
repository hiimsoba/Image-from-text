# Image-from-text
This will create an image made out of white and black squares, based on a given input, the image representing the given input converted in binary, where every black square represents a 0 and a white square represents a 1.

Red squares should be ignored, as I designed the image to have a N * N dimension.

Made using p5js, in browser.
